## Description

3D cube made with Processing.  
App I made to understand the basics of 3D projection and rotation.  
The script project a 3D rotating matrix from 3D to 2D using projection, rotation and perspective matrix basis.

- Projection matrix
- Rotation Matrix
- Perspective Matrix

## Demo

## Project architecture

The project is composed of two files, one to handle the matrix operations, the other the 3D implementation using the matrices.

matrix.pde:
- set of matrix functions (multiplication, print, ...)

cube3D.pde:
- main program that display the Cube in 3D

## Quickstart

To start the app, you need to install Processing, you can find it below:  
<https://processing.org>

Once installed, open the projects files and you'd be able to start the `cube3D.pde`.
